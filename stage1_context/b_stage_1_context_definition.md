### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method

We used four experts that did a analysis to the app using the heuristics by the Nielsen Norman Group, considering the following severity scale:

> 0 - I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all;
> 1 - Cosmetic problem;
> 2 - Minor usability problem; 
> 3 - Major usability problem;
> 4 - Usability catastrophe.

The consensus was done by collecting the issues found by the four experts and analyzing the reason behind the statement. 

#### Individual Evaluations


- [expert1_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert1_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert2_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)

- [expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook](heuristic_evaluations/expert3_heuristic_evaluation_workbook.md)


#### Consensus

>	After the individual analysis by each expert, all results should be gathered in a consensus table. If an expert has not found any of the problems found by other experts, they should analyse it, at this point, and give it a severity.

| **Issue**       | **Expert 1** | Expert 2 | Expert 3 | Expert 4 | Recommendations |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Something wrong | 3            | 1        | 0        | | Something could be done to the button to... |
| Another thing   | 4            | 3        | 4        | | Other thing to recommend                    |
| ...             |              |          |          | |                                             |

### - Cognitive Walkthrough

#### Method
[Briefly described  the method you used for the Cognitive Walkthrough analysis. ]

#### Task Selection and Task Analysis

| Task                          | Subtasks                              |
