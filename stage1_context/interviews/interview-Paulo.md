## Goals, Motivation, and Obstacles in Sports

## Functions and Usability of Sports Apps
Currently, he does not need an app. When he used to go to the gym, he only used an app to confirm whether he was attending a class or not. However, he believes that a gym-associated app could include the option to schedule classes, making the experience more organized. He thinks a good app should allow users to set exercises, record what was or wasn’t done, and save information such as workout duration. He also considers it important for the app to include a training plan.
