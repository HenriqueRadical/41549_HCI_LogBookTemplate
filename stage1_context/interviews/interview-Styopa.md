## General Questions About Daily Life and Sports Habits

Styopa starts his day with a short workout if he has time.  
He does sports, but not regularly, and would like to train 2-3 times a week. He prefers swimming, volleyball, and cycling because these activities help him relax and combine physical exercise with leisure. Styopa also practices workout exercises (bodyweight training, pull-up bars), which are convenient since they can be done anywhere. Currently, he does not use fitness apps, but he has previously tried Heria Pro.

## Goals, Motivation, and Obstacles in Sports

Styopa exercises to maintain his health, well-being, and physical fitness. The main obstacles preventing him from achieving his sports goals are the lack of a training schedule, a lack of motivation to work out, and occasionally losing sight of the importance of physical activity when it seems like skipping a workout wonâ€™t cause any harm.

## Functions and Usability of Sports Apps

For Styopa, the most important features of a sports app are ease of use, the ability to choose a training program and create a personal schedule, as well as a timer for time-based exercises and video demonstrations of correct exercise execution.  

In existing sports apps, he appreciates the option of automatically selecting a training program based on the user's physical data (height, weight, and fitness level).  

Additionally, he would find it interesting to receive short and practical tips on health, nutrition, and exercises each time he opens the app. The main drawback of current sports apps for him is the presence of ads.

## Personalization of Training and Progress Analytics

For Styopa, personalized recommendations and workouts are not particularly important, although he considers the availability of such a feature useful. Tracking progress and achievements is also not very important to him. He believes that the app would be useful if it provided information about the number of workouts per week, the total time spent on training, as well as the number of calories burned in each workout and in total for the week.

## Social Features and Interaction with Other Users

For Styopa, social features, such as the ability to share achievements or compete with friends, are not important, although he thinks that having such an option could be useful. The community does not have a significant impact on his motivation to exercise, although he acknowledges that it is easier to continue training within a group of like-minded individuals, and this plays a certain role in his motivation.
