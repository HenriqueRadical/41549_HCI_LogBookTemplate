## Main Questions 

 **1. Can you describe your typical day?** 
[I can, but my typical day is not particularly interesting. It is mostly just waking up, doing my morning routine, going to university, sticking to my schedule and then going back to my hometown to study and do other stuff. By "other stuff", I mean just enjoying my hobbies, helping the local parish and the occasional workout. Of course, I also eat during the day and go to sleep at the end of it, but I think that goes without mention .
