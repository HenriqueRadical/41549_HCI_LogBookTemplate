## Main Questions 

 **1. Can you describe your typical day?** 

I can, but my typical day is not particularly interesting. It is mostly just waking up, doing my morning routine, going to university, sticking to my schedule and then going back to my hometown to study and do other stuff. By "other stuff", I mean just enjoying my hobbies, helping the local parish and the occasional workout. Of course, I also eat during the day and go to sleep at the end of it, but I think that goes without mention .

**2. Do you engage in any sports or physical activities? If not, would you like to start in the future?** 

I engage less that I'd like to. I used to practice sports like swimming or hockey, but since starting university I have been slightly struggling to fit the sports I love into my timetable. I only workout occasionally to keep in shape, now. And, yes, I'd love to get back into those sports again, in the future.


**3. What types of sports or physical activities do you prefer? Why?** 

I like sports that push me to my limits, and have a hint of violence to them. I love to feel the adrenaline. The rush of strength you feel is unbelievable, and I like that very much. For examples, think of sports like hockey, rugby or even kickboxing. 

**4. Do you use any apps or devices for your workouts? If yes, which ones?**

No, I don't.

## Questions About Goals and Motivation 
**5. What goals do you set for yourself when engaging in sports (weight loss, muscle gain, endurance, etc.)?** 

Mostly it is endurance, I think. I love seeing how much I can take before my body starts to fail, and to see if I can push myself to push beyond limits even further next time.


**6. What motivates you to continue working out? / What motivates you to start training?** 

Even though I don't have much time on my hands right now, I keep doing it because I don't want to lose what I have gained in all my years. I am sure I already have lost a bit, but, I want to lose the least possible so I can keep going once more when I have time.


**7. What obstacles prevent you from achieving your fitness goals?** 

Right now, it's my time management not being the greatest. Also, the fact that my commute to and from university adds up to a total of around 2 hours per day, which doesn't help at all.

## Questions About Features and Usability 

**8. What features are most important to you in a fitness app?** 

I have little experience with fitness apps, but I think it is important for an app like that to have an easy to understand interface so users can easily and quickly understand how to access and set up their workout plans and what they need to do to keep fit. Besides the plans, I believe the app should have easy access to tips on how someone can pursue their goals (those goals would probably be selected by the user as they set up their account). To not leave the person in the dark, basically. The tips would range from suggested exercises to even recommending diets. The app should guide the person towards the most efficient mode to complete their objectives.
 
**9. Are there any features you would like to see in fitness apps that you haven't found yet? / What kind of support or tips would you like to receive in an app?** 

Well, as I don't really have experience, I can't really answer the first half of the question in good conscience. The second half was already somewhat answered in the previous answer. I'd like to get tips on my diet and what would be the best exercises to add to my plan according to my objectives.


**10. What do you like about existing fitness apps?** 

No comment.

**11. What frustrates or annoys you about existing fitness apps?** 

No comment.

**12. What would an ideal fitness app look like for you?** 

Honestly, that's quite hard for me to answer, since I don't really have any basis for my arguement. I think I already laid out my main points already in previous answers. The app should be easy to use, clear plans adaptable to the user's objectives and features to help with whatever the user needs.

## Questions About Personalization and Analytics

**13. How important are personalized recommendations and workouts to you?** 

Very important. I am a firm believer that the app should be the one adapting to the needs of the user, not the other way around.
 
**14. How important is progress tracking and achievement monitoring for you?** 

Not very important, honestly, but I believe having it in the app is a net positive. It increases morale and makes people want to come back for more

**15. What kind of information or analytics about your workouts would you like to see in an app?** 

The app should keep track of the amount of time working out and the intensity of the workout, so the user can keep track of their efforts and progress.

## Questions About Social Integration

**16. How important are social features, such as sharing achievements or competing with friends?** 

Not important, but they are a nice bonus and can help some people stick with the app longer, if they have friends involved.

**17. What role does the community play in your motivation to work out?** 

Zero, honestly. I do so because I like the feeling.

**18. Do you have any suggestions for improving interaction with other users in fitness apps?** 

I don't really know how these apps work, but, maybe a way to compare a user's stats with others, and an ability to talk to them to ask them questions or share tips.
