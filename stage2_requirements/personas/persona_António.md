**Name:** António Almeida
**Age:**  27
**Occupation:** Personal trainer
**Location:** Leiria, Portugal

## Background  
António grew up in Leiria, and since he was little he has been of fan of high intensity sport activities, like soccer and basketball. As a means of improving at them, he took a liking to fitness, and to keep himself in shape,
he studied the human body, and asked for advice from multiple gym members in a gym near his home. After high school, he decided to try and find work related to his passion in all sorts of gyms, and eventually found 
himself working as a personal trainer in the gym he used to go to when he was younger. Despite living comfortably, he understands his gym lacks in comparison to others. 

## Daily Life  
The day start at 5 AM, with a light breakfast and the review and organization of both his clients' and his training routine for the day.
He arrives at his gym at around 6:30 AM, and after helping the staff setup equipment, the clients start arriving, at around 7. In between sessions, he might pause for a quick energy recharge, rechecking of his schedule, or even conversing with his clients in order to deepen their trust, which he values in his line of work.
At the end of the afternoon, after the activity at the gym has died down and clients are starting to leave, he takes the remaining time to either do his own personnal training, access the individual progress of his clients and rewrite their trainning if necessary, or even talking with the manager of the gym about its state. He returns home by 9 PM, prepares meals for the next day, and reads a little before resting for the day.

## Goals & Needs   
Despite living comfortably, he understands his gym lacks in comparison to the others he visited while looking for a job. He wants to improve not only the life of his clients, but the life of the gym as well. He wants it not only because it could increase the number of clients, but because he also wants to repay the gym that helped him figuring out his dream when he was younger. He mainly hopes to find a way to properly advertise the establishment, and convince people to give the gym a chance.
