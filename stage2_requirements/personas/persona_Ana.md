## Background  

Ana is an ambitious and curious young woman from Belarus who has decided to dedicate her life to traveling. She works as a photographer and designer, which allows her to work remotely and be free to move around. Ana completed her Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design at the Academy of Art, Architecture and Design in Prague (AAAD), where she began developing her career, combining creativity with the opportunity to live in various corners of the world. Currently, she moves to a new location every two months, which gives her the chance to immerse herself in new environments, meet new people, and explore different areas.
## Daily Life  
Ana's mornings usually begin with meditation, yoga, and light stretching, which help her set up for a productive day. She spends most of the day working â€” photography and design. Ana actively uses devices such as a camera, tablet, and laptop, and uses programs for photo editing and design. In her free time, she goes for walks, exploring new places and interacting with locals. Ana follows a healthy diet, choosing balanced foods. 

To manage her workouts and nutrition, she also uses apps, but sometimes she lacks variety in workouts that can be done anywhere and without equipment, as it takes up a lot of space in her suitcase.

## Goals & Needs  
Ana dreams of exploring as many countries as possible, getting to know different cultures, and deepening her knowledge of foreign languages. One of her needs is maintaining her health and well-being. For her, sports are not just physical activity but an important part of her personal well-being, helping her cope with the psychological and emotional stress that comes with frequent moves and new environments. Ana is open to trying new types of sports, as it is part of her drive for self-improvement and discovering new opportunities.
