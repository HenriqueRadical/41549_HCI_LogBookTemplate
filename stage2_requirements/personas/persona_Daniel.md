**Name:** Daniel Nicolas

**Age:** 26

**Occupation:** Freelancer  

**Location:** Lisbon, Portugal

## Background  
Daniel grew up in a lively urban area where independence was the norm. After high school, he jumped into freelance work, picking up gigs in design, content creation, and other digital projects. Self-taught in many ways, including fitness, Daniel prefers the flexibility of home workouts. Instead of following a strict plan, he usually remembers his routines, reflecting his laid-back lifestyle.

## Daily Life  
Daniel's day usually starts a bit later in the morning. He enjoys a slow start, catching up on news and social media over his first cup of coffee. His work hours are flexible, fitting client projects and creative work into whenever he feels inspired. Although he loves working out, relying on his memory often means he sometimes misses exercises or even forgets when to work out altogether. His smartphone and laptop keep him connected and organized throughout the day, but they also distract him from sticking to his fitness routine.

## Goals & Needs  
Daniel wants to get healthier and keep a regular workout routine without cramping his creative style. He dreams of a balanced life where his fitness supports his energy and creativity. What he really needs is a tool that fits into his unpredictable schedule - one that helps him plan, customize, and track his workouts so he doesn't miss a session. A daily progress graph and a weekly overview would be perfect to help him stay motivated.

## Pain Points & Challenges  
Daniel's biggest struggle is his irregular schedule combined with his habit of relying on memory for workouts. This means he sometimes skips key exercises or loses track of his workout times, which can be really frustrating. The lack of a structured plan makes it hard for him to see improvements, and his freelance work often takes over, pushing his fitness goals to the back of his priority.

## Motivation 
*"Why do they engage with this product or service?"*  

Daniel engages with this app because it offers the structure and reminders he's missing in his home workout routine. With the app, he can set up personalized workout schedules that fit his day, track his progress visually, and get that extra push when he's feeling unmotivated.

"I just need a system that keeps me on track without being too rigid - something that reminds me when to work out, shows my progress, and makes fitness a natural part of my day. I know that if I stay consistent, I can balance my creative freedom with a healthier lifestyle."
