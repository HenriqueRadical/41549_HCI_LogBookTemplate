## Daily Life  

The day-by-day is very rushed, Rafael wakes up at 7:00 AM, checks his phone for important notifications before having a quick meal. By 8:00 AM, he's off to the office. The mornings in the office are full of meetings while the afternoons are dedicated to data analysis. When the workday finishes, he wants to go to the gym, but he finds it very difficult as he doesn't have the workout planned and doesn't know where to save progress, refusing to use Excel due to is association with the job and its very dificult to use on phone.

## Goals & Needs  

Rafael's objective is to integrate exercise into his life, fully aware of the benefits, like increasing energy levels and reducing stress. He wants to begin withÂ weight loss and eventually starting to grow muscular mass. He is seeking an app that tracks his statistics, like calories burned and the time of workouts, while also providing him workouts based on his current goals, all to help him stay organized.

## Pain Points & Challenges  

Rafael is feeling lost in the gym and uncertain about what to train. This lack of direction has made him quite upset, as he prefers having a clear plan to follow. He struggles with tracking his workouts, as he doesn't have a user-friendly tool to register his workout and monitor his overall progress.

## Motivation    
*"I want to be fit and healthy, but I need a tool to organize that part of my life. I need a plan that adapts to my needs, helps me stay on track, and shows progress made to motivate me to keep going. I want to see real results and feel better both physically and mentally."*

Rafael wants an app that offers him ways of keeping his fitness life in place, having a prepared workout that follows his objectives, tracking his effort to see the results he wants, and that set up reminders to give him a proper motivation after work.
