# Scenarios


## Scenario 0: Maria goes on a Museum Tour (EXAMPLE, NOT FINAL)

[Maria had always loved modern art, but she often found museum visits overwhelming—so many exhibits, so much information, and little guidance on where to start. Today, she was visiting a contemporary art museum that had recently introduced an **interactive guide**.  ]

[As she entered the museum, Maria received a notification on her phone, reminding her to launch the app. She opened it and was greeted with a personalized welcome screen. The system, aware of her general interests in **digital media and abstract art**, suggested a self-guided tour tailored to her preferences.  ]

[Curious, Maria followed the suggested path. As she approached the first painting, the guide vibrated slightly—a prompt that additional content was available. Holding up the guide, she saw an **overlay** appear on the screen, revealing a time-lapse animation of the artist creating the piece. A small **audio clip** played, explaining the artist’s thought process and influences. Maria found this fascinating; it was as if the artwork was coming to life in front of her.  ]

[As she continued her tour, Maria **bookmarked** her favorite pieces, leaving notes about what she found intriguing. The system, recognizing her engagement, suggested another exhibit nearby featuring similar themes. Midway through her visit, she received a pop-up asking if she’d like a **short quiz** on the artworks she had explored, offering an interactive way to reflect on what she had learned.  ]

## Scenario 1-1: Ana improvises a 10 minute workout (EXAMPLE, MAYBE FINAL)

## Scenario 2-1: Rafael wants to do one of his favorite workouts (EXAMPLE, POSSIBLY FINAL)

## Scenario 3-1: António adds a new client in the app

After the first day of training with a new client, António asks them if they have [an app] on their phone. The client confirms they have it, and so he asks them to **add him as a dedicated personal trainer** on it.

António starts by opening the app, and **selecting the "socials" option**. Upon opening it, besides the list of all his current clients, he selects the **option to check for "student" requests**, and notices his client already sent him a request. He selects the "green accept" option next to their name, and the app sends him back to the client list, with the newly added client on the top.

By doing this, António hopes to be able to keep a recording of this particular clients **body stats**, alongside any defined **workout schedules** and have a **dedicated way to communicate** with them about fitness.

## Scenario 3-2: António creates a new personal workout for a client

After a day of training with one of his clients, they tell him that they are going on vacation for a couple of weeks and that they would like a recommendation for exercises to do at the end of an afternoon.

He decides to assign his client a simple workout for the next couple of weeks, starting by opening [the app] on his phone, going to the "socials" tab. By selecting the client in his list clients, he can **select the "organize workouts" option**, and after selecting Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as the days for the workout, he is given the **option to either use one of his already made workouts, or create a brand new one**. Seeing as this client is much older than most, and their training is different than usual, he **chooses the option to "create a new workout" from scratch**.

He selects exercises that he knows target mostly the legs and the core, as well as some specific cardio exercises, including the number of repetitions/duration of each exercise, and a small "interval of 1 minute" in between each exercise. He finishes by pressing "conclude workout".

After arriving home, he remembers that the client was still pretty inexperient, so he decides to record a video of himself performing the full workout, as a means of helping them. After recording, he reopens the app, goes back to "socials", chooses his client, and by **selecting the "edit workout" option**, he uploads his recording and appends it to the workout.

After 2 weeks, the client returns from their trip, and thanks him for the workout he sent, before returning to their regular training.
