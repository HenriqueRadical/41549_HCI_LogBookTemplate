# E.X. User Evaluation

### Questionnaire used: (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H8QAkhdtPN7zaycgIZ3NPrZoatHgb1QcJ-GEDqyLtaI/edit)

### Task 1:

**Average rating:** 5

**Notes:**
* I think everything was intuitive. Progress was easy to follow, and the necessary data was provided.
* Entering the date of birth required too much scrolling to reach 1975.

### Task 2:

**Average rating:** 4.5

**Notes:**
* When selecting the time, the default clock that appears is a bit overwhelming.
* There is no scheduling confirmation.

### Task 3:

**Average rating:** 3.67

**Notes:**
* I didn‚Äôt complete the task correctly. I explained to the observer my idea of adding fewer sets at the beginning.
* They could add an option to skip the rest time, maybe. Even though I wasn‚Äôt doing the workout, I think I spent too much time waiting for it to finish.
* The icons are a bit confusing.
* Confusion between play, pause, next, and previous.

### Task 4:

**Average rating:** 4.33

**Notes:**
* I was expecting a save button.

### Task 5:

**Average rating:** 4.83

**Notes:**
* Maybe default values.

##  System Usability Scale (SUS):

Includes 10 questions with five response options 

‚ñ™ Questions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are positively-oriented

‚ñ™ Questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 are negatively-oriented questions

### 1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
2 * 1 + 3 * 5 = 17
### 2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
4 * 5 + 3 * 1 = 23
### 3. I thought the system was easy to use.
3 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 22
### 4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
4 * 6 = 24
### 5. I found the varios funtions in this system were well integrated.
3 * 3 + 4 * 3 = 21
### 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
4 * 4 + 3 * 2 = 22
### 7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
3 * 1 + 4 * 5 = 23
### 8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
4 * 5 + 3 * 1 = 23
### 9. I felt very confident using the system.
3 * 1 + 4 * 5 = 23
### 10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.
6 * 4 = 24

(17 + 23 * 4 + 22 * 2 + 24 * 2 + 21)/6 * 2.5 = 92.5
