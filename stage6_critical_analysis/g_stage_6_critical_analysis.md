# Self-Evaluation and Workload

Eu, Ivan Horoshko não fiz nada, palavras da Maria-Aleksandra.
Andei a passear e comer Gelados para não atirar me da ponte, mas para a Maria isso é mau.

The tools used for this job were React Native with Expo Go, a framework.

Advantages:

    -> React Native helps to build code for IOs and Android devices with one code only.

    -> With Expo Go, we don't need to install Android Studio or Xcode to preview the app instantly on the phone. And we can see updates instantly too.

    -> React Native is a popular language, so there are many already-built and well-tested components that facilitate the development of the app.
The Expo offers great libraries for development.

Disadvantages:

    -> Some errors during the development weren't clear enough, spending more time trying to figure the problem out than developing the app.

    -> A new language to learn takes some time to understand how everything works.
