3. Improve the workout execution part, specifically how workout progress is displayed.
4. Add the possibility to schedule the workout from the Workout Details.
5. Added the possibility to change the day when editing a scheduled workout.
6. Develop a version of the app for smartwatches.

## Group Assessment:

###   
    -> Henrique Reveles               25%     
    -> Maria-Aleksandra Korjenevskaya 25%      
    -> Diogo Nascimento               25% 
    -> Ivan Horoshko                  25%


The tools used for this job were React Native with Expo Go, a framework.

Advantages:

    -> React Native helps to build code for IOs and Android devices with one code only.

    -> With Expo Go, we don't need to install Android Studio or Xcode to preview the app instantly on the phone. And we can see updates instantly too.

    -> React Native is a popular language, so there are many already-built and well-tested components that facilitate the development of the app.
The Expo offers great libraries for development.

Disadvantages:

    -> Some errors during the development weren't clear enough, spending more time trying to figure the problem out than developing the app.

    -> A new language to learn takes some time to understand how everything works.
