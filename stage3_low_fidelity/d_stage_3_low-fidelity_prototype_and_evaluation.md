## D.2. Prototype Evaluation

## Observations and suggestions for improvement:
### Task 1:
1) Some people did not select the weight and height units and did not click "Finish" at the end of the profile creation.
2) The way to choose the goal was not very intuitive (Lack of a dropdown-style arrow when selecting the goals).

### Task 2:
1) At first, people didn’t realize they were supposed to go to the "Calendar" located in the bottom bar (they thought they were supposed to go to "Workouts"), but later they found it intuitive.
2) Suggestion: Allow changing the day on the edit page of a scheduled exercise.

### Task 3:
1) Some people did not understand how the rest timer works.
2) Some people didn’t properly use the checkmark to mark the workout as completed.

### Task 4:
1) Some people clicked on settings instead of making changes in the statistics section.
2) Many people suggested making the weight change only in the settings.
3) One person suggested using a scroll wheel for changing the weight.

### Task 5:
1) One person didn’t understand the placement of the window for adding a new exercise.
2) It was suggested to add the 'Create workout' label next to the + button.
